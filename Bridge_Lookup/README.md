These queries were developed as a tool to identify bridges of interest along with pertinent information about them from the National Bridge Inventory (NBI) as published by the Federal Highway Administration. The 2024 inventory was used for this project. Attributes in the NBI do change from time to time so you may have to do some troubleshooting if you use these queries on an older or newer inventory.
